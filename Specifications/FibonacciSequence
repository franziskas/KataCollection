#Fibonacci Sequence Generator

## Specification
* Fibonacci sequence starts with the number `0`, followed by the number `1`;
* Each number is the addition of the 2 previous numbers;
* Meaning, number 3 is `0 + 1 = 1`, number 4 is `1 + 1 = 2`;
* There should be a facility that allows the program to print the fibonacci sequence up to a predefined length (eg. 100).

Sample output:

```
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
89
...
```

##Tips
Don't focus on the outputed list, focus on what should come out of the program first.
Eg. what is the very first thing the program should do? and the second? and the third?
Output format is not important, specially if you are practicing unit tests or TDD.
