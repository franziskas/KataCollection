# KataCollection
Collection of Kata Descriptions.
Disclaimer: None of these are mine. Taken from several git repos and blog posts or books. I aim to rewrite them into exercises as I work with them and as I do katas at our code dojo sessions or at home to better suit my purpose.

Hopefully they'll be useful to you.

I've tried my best to put the source next to each Kata in the line below. If you feel I'm breaching some copyright please let me know and I'll remove it ASAP.
